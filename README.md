A C# modification for Kerbal Space Program (KSP) originally developed by Valerian who ceased support for the modification as of:

* 4th of October 2016

As this mod used to be one of my favourites for adding immersion and an element of realism to , I decided to employ the skills I have developed over
the course of my BSc Computer Science degree to modernise this now obsolete modification and re-establish mod support to make it usable again and able to be enjoyed by
the 448,527 users which had previously used the mod.

Source code from which I began with before making my changes to make Planetshine compatible with the latest game version
can be found at: https://github.com/valerian/ksp-planetshine

### Compatibility

In its current state as of version 0.2.5.2. This modification is compatible with the KSP 1.2 Pre-Release.

*Any Version Older than KSP 1.1 is currently incompatible*

### Main Features

* Adds a "planetshine" or albedo effect to spacecraft in close proximity to planets and moons reflecting the bodies light.

* Changes the ambient lighting in a vacuum to be more realistic and very dark by default (Able to be changed in settings).

* Changes the ambient lighting on the surface and/or in the atmosphere of planets/moons to be tinted by the surface colour to add realism.

### Additional Features

* In-game settings menu to customise parameters of the modification as well a performance/quality settings.

### Known Issues and Conflicts

* Minor conflicts (Visual errors) present when used in conjunction with *Kopernicus*.

* Major conflicts (Crashes, etc) present with other mods which also attempt to alter ambient light, such as 
  *Ambient Light Adjustment* or *AmbientLightShifter*.

* Up-to Version 0.2.5.2 testing was exclusively done on the x32 version of KSP so issues may be present in the x64 version.

### Additional Information

Planet and Moon colours are able to be edited through changing "CelestialBodies.cfg" and other settings, such as vacuum 
light level and reflection intensity is able to be changed in "Settings.cfg".
